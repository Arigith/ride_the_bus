# Ride The Bus
### 1. “Red or black?”
The player guesses whether the card is **red or black**.

### 2. “Higher or lower?”
The player has to answer whether they think the card that’s about to be dealt is **higher or lower** than the first card they received,
with _Ace being the highest_.

If the two cards are the same, the dealer reshuffles the dealt card back into the deck and picks from the top again.

### 3. “In-between or outside?” 
The player has to decide whether card that’s about to be dealt will fall **in-between** the two previous cards’ values, or **outside**.

_For example, if your first two cards are four and nine, five would be “inside” while a queen would be “outside.”_

If the card is the same as either boundary card, the dealer again reshuffles the dealt card and picks from the top.

>### Bonus Round "Double or Nothing"

>The player can choose to double their win by guessing the **correct suit** of the next card.
